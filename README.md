Before Learning Excel Let's Learn Some Basic Things About Excel Workbooks

### Worksheets: 
Worksheets are the primary building blocks of an Excel workbook. Each worksheet consists of a grid of cells arranged in rows and columns. You can add, delete, rename, move, and copy worksheets within a workbook.

### Workbooks:
A workbook is a file that contains one or more worksheets in Excel. Workbooks are the primary organizational structure in Excel, and they allow users to work with and manage multiple sets of data or information within a single file.

### Cells: 
A cell is the intersection of a row and a column on a worksheet. It is the basic unit of data storage in Excel. You can enter data, formulas, and functions into cells, and format cells to control the appearance of data.

### Columns and Rows: A column is a vertical group of cells identified by a letter (A, B, C, etc.), while a row is a horizontal group of cells identified by a number (1, 2, 3, etc.). You can insert, delete, and resize columns and rows as needed.

### Formulas and Functions: Formulas are equations that perform calculations on data in cells. Functions are built-in formulas that perform specific tasks, such as SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, IF, and VLOOKUP. You can create complex formulas and functions to analyze and manipulate data.

### Charts and Graphs: Charts and graphs are visual representations of data. You can create a variety of charts and graphs, such as bar charts, pie charts, line charts, and scatter charts, to help you visualize and communicate data.

### Conditional Formatting: Conditional Formatting allows you to apply formatting to cells based on certain conditions. For example, you can use conditional formatting to highlight cells that contain a certain value, or to apply color scales to cells based on the values they contain.

### Pivot Tables: A Pivot Table is a powerful data analysis tool that allows you to summarize and analyze large amounts of data. You can create Pivot Tables to quickly analyze and summarize data by category, such as by date, by region, or by product.

### Macros: Macros are sets of instructions that automate repetitive tasks in Excel. You can create, record, edit, and run macros to save time and increase productivity.
